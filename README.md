# Backend-Journey
Documenting my ongoing learning and experiments in backend development.

This repository documents my current work and learning in backend development.

## Purpose
I use this repo to document and organize what I’m actively working on, including exercises, small experiments, and early backend projects.

The focus is on understanding how backend systems are built, how different parts connect, and how to structure code in a clear and maintainable way.

## What’s inside
- Java fundamentals and practice
- Backend related experiments and small projects
- Notes and decisions made during implementation

## How to read this repo
This is a living workspace.  
Code and structure may evolve as concepts become clearer and ideas improve.
